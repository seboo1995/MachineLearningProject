## Predicting admissions and prices with Linear Regression and Keras ANN
Codes from Graduate Admisson and Housing prices dataset(the dataset were collected on Kaggle). The first dataset was called Graduate Admission, providing data about university applicants and their chances of admission. I tried to predict the chances of admission wiht Linear Regression and Neural Networks. Additionally, I created a Linear Regression method where in the Gradient Descent method, I just used python and python libraries to compute the diferential equations and equal them to zero, so I dont have to have more computation about finding the nearest(local) minimum. The second try was with using the famous sckit-learn library where it was straight-forward. The output of the execution of the codes is provided as txt file in this repo. 
However, I wanted to test my knowledge on Aritificial Neural Networks, so I concluded to use the Keras library and tried to use their code to find my results. However I had difficulties adjusting the hyper-parameters, nevertheless I completed the code, and the results can be found also here in the txt files.
